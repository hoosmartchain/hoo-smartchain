# HooSmart Chain – HSC

English | [简体中文](README_CN.md)


## Introduction to the Hoopen Platform
The Hoopen Platform is a unified infrastructure platform based on the technical, traffic and ecological resources of the HoHooup, and will be gradually open to the blockchain industry. It will make the construction of decentralized applications more efficient and cost-effective, and provide comprehensive empowerment in aspects of promotion, traffic, and resources. In December 2020, the first product of the Hoo HooPlatform, the Hoo ECHooin, also known as HSC, officially launched its "Thunder" phase. In addition, Hoo OpenHooform will launch DEX and other blockchain infrastructures based on Layer 2. The Hoo Open PHoorm will provide global developers with series of diverse innovative facilities and services.

## Introduction to HooSmart Chain
HooSmart Chain (HSC) is a decentralized, high-efficiency and energy-saving public chain, also the first product launched by the HoHoon Platform. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high-performance transactions. The endogenous token of HSC is HOO and it adopts the PosA consensus mechanism. HSC will continue to improve the efficiency of Ethereum by Layer2, which will supplement and empower the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Declaration
To help developers’ evolvement at every stage 

## Vision
Technological innovation is the driving force behind the advancement of the blockchain industry, but many innovative projects have been misunderstood and ignored at their early stages. We have witnessed the growth process of great projects. Recalling that Ethereum and Polkadot were questioned as altcoins in the early days, they all went through difficult times. Therefore, HSC's mission is not only a public chain, but also to focus on the discovery and support of high-potential developers and innovative projects. Relying on the world's largest trading ecosystem, HSC is committed to becoming the birthplace of innovative technologies and innovative businesses, and building a complete ecological loop of technology development, application promotion, and trading.

## HSC’s Performance
- TPS: 500+
- Average block interval: 3s

## Consensus Mechanism
PosA consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 21.

## Economic Model 
The endogenous token on the chain is HOO; the transactions consume HOO as gas fee.

Miners pledge HOO to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion. 

## Cross-Chain
Assets such as BTC, ETH and stable coins can be mapped to HSC by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on HSC. 

HSC encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.  

## Meta Transaction Function
The meta-transaction function is supported, which allows users to reduce gas fees step-wise, and HSC will cover the payment of the reduced part. The meta-transaction function allows to minimize the migration cost of DApp developers, as well as to effectively reduce the cost of DApp users.

## HSC Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.

## Four Stages of HSC

## Current Stage of HSC
In December 2020, the HooSmart chain, HSC officially launched its "Thunder" phase, which will focus on improving the on-chain infrastructure, including but not limited to:
Oracles, Voting tools, Anchor Coins, DEX, Lending, Fnancial Management, Insurance, Synthetic Assets, Cross-Chain Solutions, Data Analysis, Smart Contract Innovation, etc.

## Support Plan of HSC
### Financial Support
- HSC will set up a special fund to invest, support and incentivize high-potential developers.
- HSC will launch a variety of developer activities and competitions to discover and fund potential developers. 
- In order to reduce the cost of users on HSC Dapp, the HSC meta transaction function will reduce the gas fee of users holding HOO in a step-wise manner.

### Traffic Support
Hoolobal will strongly support the development of HSC ecosystem:
- Provide traffic entrance for high-quality Dapp on HSC.
- After running successfully on HSC, high-quality projects can submit token listing application to Hoolobal, and can be listed on HoHoobal if they meet the listing standards.

### Resource Support
- Projects or developers that have received investment and support from HSC have not only the opportunity to get official news report, but also can apply for marketing service packages and promote their projects globally.
- High-quality projects can participate in HSC global roadshows for free.
- Hooroup will open up ecological resources to high-potential developers, matching the win-win cooperation between developers and our ecological partners.
